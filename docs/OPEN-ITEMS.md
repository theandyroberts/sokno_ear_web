# Open items

One ledger for everything the recurring checks have found and not yet closed.

**Why this file exists.** On 2026-09-01 the SEO check found `www.soknoear.com`
serving a duplicate of the whole site. It reported it exactly as designed — into a
terminal transcript — and nobody saw it. Two weeks later the next run found the same
thing and reported it the same way. Andy learned about it by noticing a warning
triangle. A finding that lives only in a report nobody opens is not a finding.

**The rule.** Every recurring check reads this file first and writes it last.

- An item gets an **Opened** date and never loses it. Age is the escalation signal.
- A check **pushes a notification only for BLOCKING items** — something is broken,
  or something needs a decision only Andy can make. Everything else lands here quietly.
- Ages **7** and **14** days re-fire the notification for an item already open. That
  is the escalation that did not happen for the www redirect.
- A check that finds nothing blocking sends **nothing**. A channel that fires every
  run is a channel that gets ignored, which is how this started.
- **Close items here.** An item that is fixed moves to Closed with what fixed it.

**Channels.** `scripts/notify.mjs` fans out to whatever is configured — Resend email,
and SMS from the Ear's own AgentPhone line when `ALERT_SMS_TO` is set on the VPS.
Checks running on the Mac mini use `PushNotification` (desktop + phone). Email alone
is not sufficient: Andy runs 100+ unread on a normal day.

## Open

**Names, not numbers.** Items are called what they are ("Venue outreach"). The lettered
tickets the Instagram reviews used until 2026-09-28 (A1–A16) meant nothing to Andy and are
retired; where an old one appears below, its name is beside it. Things Andy can answer are
**moves** on the dashboard (`node scripts/pub-status.mjs moves`).

### 1. A weekly Reel from the audio briefing — sample delivered, publish half owed
**Opened:** 2026-09-28 · **Age: 7 days** (as of 2026-10-05) · **Claude's** · **Move:** `weekly-reel` · **Due: Wed 2026-10-14**

**2026-10-05:** the sample is on the dashboard (run 10) and at
`https://note15.com/insta/img/soknoear/2026-10-05_reel-sample.mp4`: 46 s, 1080×1920, the
No. 16 briefing's open and its Carrie paragraph over five banners, the spoken line burned in
under the picture. Built with Pillow frames + ffmpeg's concat demuxer (the mini's ffmpeg has no
`drawtext`); paragraph boundaries from `silencedetect`. Recipe in `docs/ig-reviews/2026-10-05.md`.
**The first Reel rides the No. 18 drip on Wed Oct 14 unless Andy answers "Don't"** on the page.

*To do, Mon Oct 12 review:* `scripts/ig-reel.mjs` (build the mp4 from `content/audio-scripts/<date>.md`,
`public/audio/<date>.mp3`, `public/assets/ig/<date>/`), and the publish half in
`scripts/ig-container.mjs`: `media_type=REELS`, public `video_url`, a longer `FINISHED` wait
(video processing takes minutes, not seconds), a `reel` post in the queue after the roundup.
Check `moves` first — a "Don't" closes this item instead.

### 2. Fewer posts reached fewer people — the roundup and its first fixes, read again Oct 12
**Opened:** 2026-10-05 · **Claude's** · **Moves:** `venue-singles`, `tag-every-post` (both live Wed Oct 7)

No. 16 went out as 8 posts (the roundup week) where No. 15 had 14. Per-post reach rose
4.9 → 5.9 at equal age and no post read below 4, but weekly reach fell 69 → 47, unique
people reached 25 → 19, views 176 → 84, and non-follower reach for the week was 1. Both
carousels read 4 — the weekend roundup exactly what the episode card read, and the Ijams
carousel 4 for three stories that as singles would have read about 13.

Shipped 2026-10-05: **every story keeps its single post** (`venueCarouselsOn` in
`scripts/ig-roundup.mjs`, off unless Andy says "Don't" to `venue-singles`); **every venue
post is tagged in the image** (`userTagsFor` / `imageTagsOn` in `scripts/ig-container.mjs`,
the old 50/50 split returns on "Don't" to `tag-every-post`). The weekend roundup stays on top.

*Measures for Oct 12 (No. 17):* weekly reach at equal age above 69; no post below 3; every
tagged post carries `userTags`; per-window non-follower reach 5 or more; the roundup's saves
and whether it beats 6. *If the roundup hasn't beaten 6 by Oct 19 it goes back to the card.*

### 3. Search Console is unreadable from the Mac mini
**Opened:** 2026-08-15 · **Age: 51 days** (as of 2026-10-05) · **Missed 3 of 4 SEO checks**
· **Needs Andy** · not blocking — no push (the site-side half covers breakage; this only costs the crawl numbers)

**2026-10-01:** missed again — no Chrome extension connected, Browser pane signed out.
Sitemap is now 135 URLs (+41 since 2026-09-15), so the uncrawled-share question has
grown, not shrunk.

No Chrome extension connected to the mini, and the Browser pane has no Google session,
so `sc-domain:soknoear.com` bounces to the signed-out page. The 2026-09-01 run got in
and is the only real data on record.

This blocks the one number worth watching: **64 of the then-80 sitemap URLs had never
been crawled** (all showing *Last crawled: N/A*). The sitemap is 94 URLs now. Two fixes
shipped 2026-09-15 that should move it — the www consolidation and story links on
`/archive` — and neither can be measured without this.

*To close:* leave Chrome running with the Claude extension connected when the check
fires (1st and 15th), or open Search Console and paste the Page indexing numbers.

## Closed

| Item | Opened | Closed | What fixed it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Venue outreach**: the venues had never heard from the Ear (carried through 9 Instagram reviews, 48 days at the last) | 2026-08-11 | 2026-10-03 | Andy sent the five first notes himself: Legacy Parks Sep 29, Earl's, Ijams and Kern's Oct 1, Puckers Oct 3 (Instagram DM). `content/contacts.json` records each as `introduced`; `scripts/venue-notify.mjs` sends their weekly note itself from the No. 17 publish. Still to come: the first reshare |
| The image-tag test (`user_tags`, 50/50 by story id, Sep 16 – Oct 4) | 2026-09-07 | 2026-10-05 | Decided: tagged 9.0 against untagged 6.6 reach a post over three weeks, ahead every week; every venue post is now tagged in the image (`userTagsFor`). The split is kept behind Andy's "Don't" |
| A venue's folded stories went out as one carousel of their own ("3 more at Ijams Park", read 4 for three stories) | 2026-09-28 | 2026-10-05 | `venueCarouselsOn` is off: every story keeps its single post; the two-posts-a-day venue cap already stops the stacking the fold was for. The weekend roundup itself stays (item 2 above) |
| The carousel publish path had only run against a fake Instagram | 2026-09-28 | 2026-09-30 | No. 16: both carousels published as carousels, 10+1 and 3+1 containers, no `downgradedFrom`; publish check and the Oct 5 review confirm |
| The equal-age reading said age ≥2 was within 6% of final | 2026-09-28 | 2026-10-05 | It wasn't: No. 15 grew 35% after age 2–5, No. 14 another 15% after age 8. Revised in `docs/ig-reviews/2026-10-05.md`: expect +30–35% from age 2–5, +10–15% from age 8 |
| Instagram banners were a wall of teal (9 of 12 in No. 15): the band took the place's pill colour, and the place was Ijams Park | 2026-09-28 | 2026-09-28 | `band_colors` in `scripts/ig-banners.py`: a place keeps its colour for its first story of the week, the rest take the least-used palette colour; `social.igBand` overrides; `tests/ig-band-colors.test.ts` |
| Artwork drew the whole scene (the quarry, the class, the lawn) where the best-read posts are one object up close | 2026-09-28 | 2026-09-28 | "One subject, close in" in `.claude/skills/sokno-ear-art/SKILL.md`, and the Tuesday draft task now loads that skill before drawing. First used on No. 16; the Oct 5 review compares |
| One venue filled a day of the Instagram drip (No. 15: three Ijams banners Thursday, four Saturday, read 2, 2, 7 and 2, 6, 5, 1) | 2026-09-28 | 2026-09-28 | `placeDaySlots` takes each post's venue: two posts a day per venue, the rest move earlier in the week, never before publish day, nothing dropped; 7 tests in `tests/ig-day-slots.test.ts` (two posts a day per venue). First live week is No. 16 |
| Same-day Instagram posts stacked an hour apart (No. 14's Sunday: 4 Ijams banners 08–11, read 4/5/2/5) | 2026-09-21 | 2026-09-21 | `placeDaySlots` in `ig-schedule.mjs`: ≥2h same-day spacing, collisions walk earlier, overflow to the day before; `tests/ig-day-slots.test.ts` (same-day spacing) |
| The image tag test's measure (per-post non-follower reach) can't be read: API rejects `follow_type` on media insights | 2026-09-21 | 2026-09-21 | Measure redefined to per-post reach/views by arm plus account-level non-follower count; A/B continues through No. 16 |
| Post failures / lead-card slot / standing cap: measures confirmed on a live week | 2026-09-15 | 2026-09-21 | No. 14: 13/13 posted, 0 retries, lead cards 13:00, 2 repeats held (retry-and-alert, lead-card aiming and the standing cap, closed in the IG review) |
| `www.soknoear.com` served the whole site with no redirect | 2026-09-01 | 2026-09-15 | Apex-only serving block + redirect-only 443 block for www + port-80 hop to the literal apex. `dad9825` |
| Instagram posts failed silently and permanently (2 lost) | 2026-09-15 | 2026-09-15 | `ig-post.mjs`: in-run publish retry on transients, `failed` made non-terminal with a 4-tick budget, `notify.mjs` on exhaustion, dated posts dropped rather than published hours late |
| Standing-item cap reset on a retitle | 2026-09-15 | 2026-09-15 | Cap counts by `social.standingKey ?? id`; `social.standing` marks an item standing from run one; 20 archive stories keyed |
| Lead cards took the 17:00 cell on a late publish | 2026-09-15 | 2026-09-15 | `nextLeadWindow` aims the pair at the next 09:00–13:00 window, clamped so it never pushes the stories it introduces |
| `user_tags` A/B never ran | 2026-09-07 | 2026-09-15 | Deterministic 50/50 split in `ig-queue.mjs`, `user_tags` on container creation in `ig-post.mjs`, captions held identical |
| 77 story pages had one inbound link each | 2026-09-15 | 2026-09-15 | `/archive` links every story title instead of printing it as text |
| `/stats` 404 noise in Page indexing | 2026-09-01 | 2026-09-28 | **Reverted, not fixed.** The 2026-09-15 `Disallow: /stats` prefix-matched `/stats/script.js` and blocked the Umami tracker on every page; Google mailed a "Blocked by robots.txt" alert on 2026-09-28. The 404 was the better state and is back. See the lesson below |
| Repo nginx config had drifted from live | 2026-09-15 | 2026-09-15 | `deploy/soknoear.com.nginx` re-synced |

## Lessons

**2026-09-28 — don't silence cosmetic noise with robots.txt.** The `/stats` 404 was
logged as "Harmless" on 2026-09-01 and then "fixed" anyway on 2026-09-15. `Disallow`
is a prefix match, so the fix blocked `/stats/script.js` — the analytics tracker on
100% of pages — and produced a louder problem than the one it removed, thirteen days
later, by email, to Andy.

Two rules out of it:

1. **A `Disallow` path blocks everything beneath it.** Before adding one, list what
   actually serves under that prefix. `curl` each path.
2. **Noise that a check has already called harmless does not need fixing.** A 404
   ages out on its own. A robots block does not — it stays in the report indefinitely
   and can be indexed with no content. Removing a report row is not a goal; the
   report is an instrument, not the thing being optimised.
